# AdmiralSquidstatAPI

This repo includes the API bundle for public use as well as documentation for using the API.
The Admiral Instruments API gives more control of [our potentiostats](https://www.admiralinstruments.com/products), and gives you the
tools to integrate running our experiments in your pipeline and automating your workflow.
